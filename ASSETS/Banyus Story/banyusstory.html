        <img src="coverimage.png" alt="Cover image" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://placehold.co/900x400/cccccc/ffffff?text=coverimage.png+not+found';">
      </div>

      <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
      <div class="story-block">
        <img src="image1.png" alt="Image 1 — City static" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full mb-6" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://placehold.co/900x500/cccccc/ffffff?text=image1.png+not+found';">
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">Banyu, a gifted architect in the heart of bustling Chicago, felt trapped. The city’s vibrant energy, once his greatest inspiration, now just felt like noise. A prestigious cultural center project lay stalled on his desk, its blank pages mocking his creative silence. The weight of expectation was heavier than the humid city air.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
      <div class="story-block">
        <img src="image2.png" alt="Image 2 — A friend’s suggestion" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full mb-6" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://placehold.co/900x500/cccccc/ffffff?text=image2.png+not+found';">
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">A friend mentioned something new: microDOS(2). Not a wild escape, his friend explained, but a tool for focus. “It is like turning down the static so you can hear the music,” the friend had said. Skeptical but feeling the pressure, Banyu ordered a trial. A few days later, a small, discreet package arrived at his door.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
      <div class="story-block">
        <img src="image3.png" alt="Image 3 — A quiet Saturday" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full mb-6" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://placehold.co/900x500/cccccc/ffffff?text=image3.png+not+found';">
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">On a quiet Saturday, with no deadlines looming, he decided to try it. He carefully split one of the small, scored tablets into a quarter piece, following the guide for a light microdose. He took a deep breath, placed the piece on his tongue, and waited, not for a storm, but for a subtle shift in the weather of his mind.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
      <div class="story-block">
        <img src="image4.png" alt="Image 4 — Walking the Gold Coast" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full mb-6" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://placehold.co/900x500/cccccc/ffffff?text=image4.png+not+found';">
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">There was no sudden jolt, no kaleidoscope of colors. Feeling calm, Banyu left his apartment to wander the historic streets of the Gold Coast. He left frustration behind and decided to simply walk and to see, with no agenda.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Paragraph 5 -->
      <div class="story-block">
        <img src="image5.png" alt="Image 5 — Details sharpen" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full mb-6" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://placehold.co/900x500/cccccc/ffffff?text=image5.png+not+found';">
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">As he walked, the world seemed to sharpen its edges: the intricate carvings on a wooden door, the rich, earthy scent of roasted coffee from a nearby café, the way sunlight dappled through the leaves of a massive elm tree. The city’s usual roar softened into a gentle, rhythmic hum.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Paragraph 6 -->
      <div class="story-block">
        <img src="image6.png" alt="Image 6 — Sketchbook opened" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full mb-6" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://placehold.co/900x500/cccccc/ffffff?text=image6.png+not+found';">
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">He found a small café and ordered a coffee. For the first time in weeks, he opened his sketchbook not with a sense of duty, but with a feeling of play. He did not try to design the cultural center. He simply let his pen drift, sketching the patterns he saw around him.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Paragraph 7 -->
      <div class="story-block">
        <img src="image7.png" alt="Image 7 — Lines flow" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full mb-6" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://placehold.co/900x500/cccccc/ffffff?text=image7.png+not+found';">
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">The lines flowed. The curve of a window arch merged with the organic pattern of a batik‑inspired motif he remembered from childhood. The rigid geometry of the city began to dance with the soft, natural forms he had just admired. He was not forcing anything; he was observing connections already there.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Paragraph 8 -->
      <div class="story-block">
        <img src="image8.png" alt="Image 8 — The spark" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full mb-6" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://placehold.co/900x500/cccccc/ffffff?text=image8.png+not+found';">
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">And then, it sparked. A clear, brilliant idea: the roof of the cultural center. It would sweep upward like a traditional Joglo house, formed in a modern, latticed structure that scattered light onto the floors below, the way the elm’s canopy did. A fusion of heritage and home.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Paragraph 9 -->
      <div class="story-block">
        <img src="image9.png" alt="Image 9 — Flow restored" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full mb-6" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://placehold.co/900x500/cccccc/ffffff?text=image9.png+not+found';">
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">He rushed back to his office, heart pounding with excitement rather than anxiety. The creative block crumbled, washed away by a gentle current of clarity. The design poured out of him, each line confident and purposeful.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Paragraph 10 -->
      <div class="story-block">
        <img src="image10.png" alt="Image 10 — Final blueprint" class="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full mb-6" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://placehold.co/900x500/cccccc/ffffff?text=image10.png+not+found';">
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">Banyu stood before the final blueprint, a piece of modern Indonesian American architecture. The static was gone. In its place: quiet confidence and a renewed connection to creativity. He had found the music again, and it was beautiful.</p>
